JavaScript challenges on Asynchronous programming - challenges


  //Q1 -Create a function which receives a function as argument and executes it after 2 seconds
  //Q2- Print numbers from 1 to 10 with delay of 1 second between each value being printed
  /**
   * Q. Print numbers from 1 to 10 with delay of 1 second between each value being printed using setInterval
   * Q. Print numbers from 10 to 1 with delay of 1 second between each value being printed using setTimeout using pre ES6 features only
    Q. Write a utility which prints numbers starting from an initial value and increment in steps which can be started and stopped by the user, any number of times
    Q. Execute an array of asynchronous functions one after the other in sequence using callbacks

    Q. Execute the given list of asynchronous functions in parallel and return the results as an array to the callback

Q. Execute 3 asynchronous functions one after the other in sequence using promise chaining

Q. Execute 3 asynchronous functions one after the other in sequence using async await

Q. Execute 3 asynchronous functions one after the other in sequence using promise chaining and do not terminate on failure

Q. Execute 3 asynchronous functions one after the other in sequence using async await and do not terminate on failure

Q. Execute an array of asynchronous functions which returns a promise, one after the other in sequence

Q. Design a utility which takes array of asynchronous functions and returns the 1st successful or non successful result with max waiting time set by the user

Q. Design a utility which takes URL and a value for attempts which will attempt to make a fetch request. If on failure it tries again with increasing delay for number of times which user has requested

Q. Create a generator to return a random number on every request

Q. Search for the presence of a given value in the nested object using generator
